# chat_overlay_streamelements
Working on a chat that can be use on StreamElements. The code is based on the original widgets repo of StreamElements (https://github.com/StreamElements/widgets) on customChat. Trying to make a easy to read and edit version for those who wants to make quick changes for their stream.
